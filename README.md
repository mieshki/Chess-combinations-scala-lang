###Chess Challenge 

Below you willfindthedescriptionofthe problem.UsingScalalanguage(no speciallibraries areneeded but 
you can use external ones if you feel such need), please provide an answer for the question at the end.
You should be able to finish the assessment within one week. If you cannot find the solution, please do not worry;
it’s not an easy task and we would like to see your thinking and problem solving abilities more than an accurate answer.

Problem
The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with                             
dimensions M×N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Providing the number of
results is useful, but not enough to complete the assignment. Assume the colour of the piece does no
matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces. 

Write a program whick takes as input:
*The dimensions od the board: M, N
*The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

As output, the program should list all the unique configurations to the console for which all of the pieces can be
placed on the board without threatening each other.
